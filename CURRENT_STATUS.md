## 🚧 **NEW FEATURE: Friend Requests & Chat** (In Progress)

I've started implementing the friend request and chat system. Here's what's been created:

### Backend (Partially Complete):
✅ FriendRequest model created
✅ Message model created
✅ User model updated with friends array
✅ Friend request controller created with:
   - Send friend request
   - Get received requests
   - Accept request
   - Reject request
   - Get friends list

### Still Needed:
⏳ Message controller
⏳ Friend & Chat routes
⏳ Search users functionality
⏳ Frontend components (FriendsList, Chat, SearchUsers)
⏳ Real-time chat (Socket.io)

---

## 📊 **Current Working Status**

```
✅ Backend Server:  Running on port 5000
✅ Frontend Server: Running on port 3000  
✅ MongoDB:         Connected to Atlas
✅ Firebase Auth:   Active
✅ Video Storage:   Server-based (working!)
✅ Profile Page:    Fixed (reduce error resolved)
```
