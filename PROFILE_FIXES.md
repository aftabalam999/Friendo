# ✅ Profile Page - Fixes & Improvements

## 🔧 **Issues Fixed**

### 1. ✅ **Videos Not Showing**
**Problem**: User videos weren't displaying on profile page

**Fix**: 
- Fixed API response data extraction
- Added proper handling for `response.data` format
- Added Array.isArray() checks for safety
- Added console logging for debugging

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
const response = await videoService.getUserVideos(user.uid);
const videos = response.data || response || [];
setUserVideos(Array.isArray(videos) ? videos : []);
```

### 2. ✅ **Liked Videos Not Working**
**Problem**: "Liked" tab showed "not uploaded yet" message

**Fix**:
- Added `likedVideos` state
- Created `fetchLikedVideos()` function
- Filter videos by `likedBy` array containing current user
- Tab now switches between user videos and liked videos

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
const [likedVideos, setLikedVideos] = useState([]);

const fetchLikedVideos = async () => {
  const response = await videoService.getAllVideos();
  const allVideos = response.data || response || [];
  const liked = allVideos.filter(video => 
    video.likedBy && video.likedBy.includes(user.uid)
  );
  setLikedVideos(liked);
};
```

### 4. ✅ **Stats Display Fixed**
**Problem**: Stats showed incorrect or zero values

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Videos count
{Array.isArray(userVideos) ? userVideos.length : 0}

// Total likes
{Array.isArray(userVideos) ? 
  userVideos.reduce((acc, video) => acc + (video.likes || 0), 0) 
  : 0}

// Total views  
{Array.isArray(userVideos) ? 
  userVideos.reduce((acc, video) => acc + (video.views || 0), 0) 
  : 0}
```
