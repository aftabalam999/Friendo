# ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes Summary - Friendo

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Logout Not Working Properly
**Problem:** User couldn't logout properly - the state wasn't clearing

**Solution:**
- Updated [`useAuth.js`](client/src/hooks/useAuth.js):
  - Added immediate `setUser(null)` before clearing storage
  - Added console logging for debugging
  - Ensured user state clears even if there's an error
  - Socket disconnects properly before logout

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/hooks/useAuth.js`

---

### 2. âœ… Feed Not Loading After Login (Need to Refresh)
**Problem:** After first-time login, users had to refresh the page to see the feed and navbar

**Solution:**
- Modified login function in [`useAuth.js`](client/src/hooks/useAuth.js):
  - Moved `setLoading(false)` outside finally block
  - This forces a state update that triggers re-renders
  - Ensures UI updates immediately after successful login

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/hooks/useAuth.js`

---

### 3. âœ… Friend Search Not Working
**Problem:** Cannot find friends by name or username - using Firebase UID instead of MongoDB _id

**Solution:**
- Updated all friend-related functions to use JWT MongoDB `_id` instead of Firebase `uid`

**Backend Changes (`server/controllers/friendController.js`):**
1. **getPendingRequests**
   - Changed from `req.user.uid` to `req.user.id`
   - Changed from `User.findOne({ uid })` to `User.findById(userId)`
   - Updated query to use `receiver` ObjectId instead of `receiverId` string

2. **getSentRequests**
   - Changed from `req.user.uid` to `req.user.id`
   - Changed from `User.findOne({ uid })` to `User.findById(userId)`
   - Updated query to use `sender` ObjectId instead of `senderId` string

3. **acceptFriendRequest**
   - Changed from `req.user.uid` to `req.user.id`
   - Updated authorization check to compare ObjectIds
   - Changed friend updates to use ObjectId references

4. **rejectFriendRequest**
   - Changed from `req.user.uid` to `req.user.id`
   - Updated authorization check to compare ObjectIds

5. **getFriendsList**
   - Changed from `req.user.uid` to `req.user.id`
   - Changed from `User.findOne({ uid })` to `User.findById(userId)`
   - Added `id` field mapping for frontend compatibility

6. **searchUsers**
   - Changed from `req.user.uid` to `req.user.id`
   - Changed from `{ uid: { $ne: userId } }` to `{ _id: { $ne: userId } }`
   - Now searches by `displayName`, `username`, and `email` (case-insensitive)
   - Returns users with `id` field for frontend compatibility
   - Added better logging

7. **removeFriend**
   - Changed from `req.user.uid` to `req.user.id`
   - Changed from `User.findOne({ uid })` to `User.findById()`
   - Updated to use ObjectId references

**Frontend Changes (`client/src/pages/FriendsPage.jsx`):**
- Updated all user references to use `_id` or `id` instead of `uid`
- Added fallback checks: `friend._id || friend.id`
- Updated search results mapping
- Updated friend list mapping
- Updated request handling
- Changed username display from `uid.slice(0, 8)` to `'user'` as fallback

**Files Modified:**
- `server/controllers/friendController.js`
- `client/src/pages/FriendsPage.jsx`

---

## Additional Updates

### 4. âœ… App Name Updated
**Changed from "Trendo" to "Friendo" in:**
- `client/src/App.jsx` - Loading screen logo (T â†’ F)
- `client/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` - Logo and brand name

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/App.jsx`
- `client/src/components/Sidebar.jsx`

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
```
Login â†’ Store tokens â†’ Set user state â†’ Connect socket â†’ Navigate to home
Logout â†’ Disconnect socket â†’ Clear user state â†’ Clear storage â†’ Navigate to /auth
```

### Friend Search Flow
```
User types query (min 2 chars)
  â†“
Frontend calls: GET /api/friends/search?query=...
  â†“
Backend searches MongoDB users by:
  - displayName (case-insensitive)
  - username (case-insensitive)
  - email (case-insensitive)
  â†“
Returns max 20 users with id field
  â†“
Frontend displays results with actions:
  - Add Friend (if not friend)
  - Message (if already friend)
  - Sent (if request already sent)
```

### Data Model Changes
**Before:** Used Firebase UID strings
```javascript
userId: "firebase-uid-string"
friends: ["uid1", "uid2"]
```

**After:** Uses MongoDB ObjectId
```javascript
userId: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011")
friends: [ObjectId("..."), ObjectId("...")]
```

## Server Restart Required

After these changes, the backend server automatically restarted (nodemon).
Frontend doesn't need restart, but users should refresh the page.

---

## API Endpoints Updated

### Friend Routes (all now use MongoDB _id)
- `GET /api/friends/search?query=...` - Search users
- `GET /api/friends` - Get friends list
- `GET /api/friends/requests/pending` - Get pending requests
- `GET /api/friends/requests/sent` - Get sent requests
- `POST /api/friends/requests` - Send friend request
- `PUT /api/friends/requests/:id/accept` - Accept request
- `PUT /api/friends/requests/:id/reject` - Reject request
- `DELETE /api/friends/:id` - Remove friend

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Username Fallback**: If user doesn't have a username, displays "user" instead
2. **Email Search**: Users can be found by email (might want to remove this for privacy)
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Search is case-insensitive (good for UX)

---

## Future Improvements

1. Add username generation on signup
2. Add "Recently Active" indicator on friends list
3. Add friend request notifications
4. Add mutual friends count
5. Add ability to block users
6. Add friend suggestions based on mutual friends
