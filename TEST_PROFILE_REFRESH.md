## 🐛 If Issues Occur

### Issue: Changes still resetting

**Check:**
1. Is backend server running? (`http://localhost:5000`)
2. Is frontend server running? (`http://localhost:3000`)
3. Are you logged in?
4. Check browser console (F12) for errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Restart both servers
# Terminal 1
cd server
npm start

# Terminal 2
cd client
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Profile not updating

**Check:**
1. Did you click "Save Changes"?
2. Did you see success message?
3. Did page reload after save?

**Debug:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Edit and save profile
4. Look for:
   - `POST /api/users/{userId}/photo` (if image uploaded)
   - `PUT /api/users/{userId}` (profile update)
   - `GET /api/users/{userId}` (profile fetch)
5. Check response status (should be 200 OK)

## 📊 What Changed

### Technical Changes:

1. **`useAuth.js` hook:**
   - Now fetches MongoDB user data on auth state change
   - Merges MongoDB data with Firebase auth object
   - MongoDB values override Firebase defaults

2. **`ProfilePage.jsx`:**
   - Added page reload after profile update
   - Ensures auth context refreshes with new data

### Data Priority:
```
MongoDB displayName > Firebase displayName
MongoDB photoURL > Firebase photoURL
```

**Result:** Your updated profile always shows, not Firebase defaults!
