# 📹 Video Upload Migration - Firebase Storage → Server Storage

## ✅ What Was Changed

### **Problem**: Firebase Storage CORS errors blocking video uploads

### **Solution**: Switched to server-based video storage using Multer

---

## 🔄 Changes Made

### Backend Changes:
1. ✅ Added `multer` configuration (`server/config/upload.js`)
2. ✅ Created `uploads/videos` directory for storing videos
3. ✅ Updated `videoRoutes.js` to use multer middleware
4. ✅ Modified `videoController.js` to handle file uploads
5. ✅ Added static file serving for uploaded videos
6. ✅ Videos now stored at: `server/uploads/videos/`

### Frontend Changes:
1. ✅ Removed Firebase Storage imports from `UploadModal.jsx`
2. ✅ Changed upload logic to use FormData
3. ✅ Added upload progress tracking
4. ✅ Updated API service to support progress callbacks

---

## 📊 How It Works Now

### Upload Flow:
1. User selects video file
2. Frontend creates FormData with video + metadata
3. POST request to `/api/videos` with multipart/form-data
4. Backend saves video to `uploads/videos/` folder
5. Backend creates database record with video URL
6. Video URL format: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/videos/[filename]`

### Video Access:
- Videos served as static files from `/uploads` route
- No CORS issues (same domain as API)
- Faster uploads (no third-party service)
- Full control over storage

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **Backend**: 
- Server running on port 5000
- Upload endpoint ready: POST `/api/videos`
- Static file serving enabled
- Multer configured (100MB max)

✅ **Frontend**:
- Upload modal updated
- FormData implementation
- Progress tracking working
- No Firebase Storage dependency

✅ **Database**:
- MongoDB connected
- Video schema ready
- User sync working
